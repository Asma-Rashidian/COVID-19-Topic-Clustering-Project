    "## Methods Comparison\n",
    "1. **Clustering Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Kmeans vs. Hierarchical Clustering:** \n",
    "     - Kmeans with T-SNE consistently outperforms Kmeans with PCA, indicating that non-linear dimensionality reduction (T-SNE) provides better separation of clusters compared to linear methods (PCA).\n",
    "     - Hierarchical clustering with T-SNE generally yields higher silhouette scores than with PCA, showcasing the effectiveness of T-SNE in capturing complex relationships within data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TF-IDF vs. Word2Vec Representations:**\n",
    "   - **Kmeans vs. Hierarchical Clustering:**\n",
    "     - In both TF-IDF and Word2Vec representations, Kmeans and hierarchical clustering show different performance depending on the linkage method and the choice of representation.\n",
    "     - Word2Vec with T-SNE consistently demonstrates better clustering results, indicating that the semantic relationships captured by Word2Vec are better represented in lower-dimensional space using T-SNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classification Performance:**\n",
    "   - **SGD Classification:**\n",
    "     - Using TF-IDF based Kmeans and T-SNE representations leads to better classification results compared to Word2Vec, showcasing the relevance of feature representation in classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overall Observations:**\n",
    "   - It's evident that the choice of feature representation (TF-IDF vs. Word2Vec) and dimensionality reduction technique (PCA vs. T-SNE) significantly impacts clustering and classification performance.\n",
    "   - The linkage method in hierarchical clustering plays a crucial role in determining cluster quality, with complete and average linkage generally performing better than single and ward linkage in various scenarios.\n"
